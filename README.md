# Concentration Calculator

I am trying to make some simple tools for scientist to use in the lab as a way to practice coding with python

This is a PyQt5-based desktop application designed for chemists and researchers to calculate the new concentration of a solution after mixing two different solutions (containing the same substance). 
It supports various concentration units (pM, nM, µM, mM, M) and volume units (L, mL, µL). The app handles unit conversions automatically, making it easy to perform precise calculations in laboratory settings.

I am an electrochemist and I don't really understand how to code properly... so everytime I want to use the calculator I run the code in VScode. 
I don't know how to structure the code or what I need to do to make it so I can have a folder on my desktop with shorts to the tools I am developing. 


## Features

- User-friendly GUI to input concentration and volume values.
- Supports multiple concentration and volume units, including automatic conversions.
- Calculates the new concentration after mixing two solutions.
- Displays the final concentration in µM (micromolar) by default.
